Using Command-Line Interface instead of IDE

Requirements:
- text editor (notepad, etc)
- command prompt or terminal
- installed C++ compiler

Why Do This?
- no IDE
- simple, efficient workflow
- better for experienced users
- better for limited hardware resources

Things to Remember:
- You have to organize your own directory structure
- compiler manually with g++ (Windows)
	- cd "change directory"
	- dir "list directory contents
	- Compile: g++ -Wall -std=c++14 <filename.cpp>
		OR g++ -Wall -std=c++14 <filename.cpp> -o <executableName.exe>
	- will create a .exe file
	- Run: just type filename.cpp in terminal
