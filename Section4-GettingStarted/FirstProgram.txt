How to Build a Program

- Source code
- COMPILE - checks source for errors and creates .obj files (binaries)
- BUILD - both compiles and links dependencies and outputs an exe
- CLEAN - removes .object and .exe files and takes project back to clean state with JUST source code

ERRORS in Build Process
- Compiler Errors
	- Compiler strictly enforces programming language rules
	- Syntax errors!
		- when something is wrong with the structure
		- missing ; for instance
	- Semantic errors
		- when something is wrong with the meaning
		- a + b; when these are two different data types, etc.
- Compiler Warnings
	- Don't just ignore these!!!
	- compiler can still generate object code from source
- Linker Errors
	- linker error is when program is missing an object file or library
	- linker takes compiled source code and links it with any external libraries
- Runtime Errors
    - problem that takes place when the program is successfully executing
    - Ex: out of memory, file not found, divide by zero
    - exception handling is the appropriate way to deal with these errors
- Logic Errors
    - bugs in code that cause incorrect outputs in an executed program
    - many causes including incomplete information, errors added by another programmer, etc.
    - testing and debugging is the appropriate way to deal with these errors
